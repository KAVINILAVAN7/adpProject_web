        <h3 <b>Popular Toppings</b></h3>
        <h4>Traditional: Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil, mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage.</h4>
        <h4>Gourmet/Creative: Prosciutto, arugula, truffles, figs, barbecue chicken, pineapple.</h4>
        <p>These are the more traditional ingredients typically associated with Italian pizza and popular in pizzerias worldwide.

            Cheese: Mozzarella is the most commonly used cheese on pizza, but other varieties like provolone, Parmesan, ricotta, and gorgonzola are also popular.
            Tomato Sauce: A key base for many pizzas, made from tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and sometimes herbs.
            Pepperoni: A spicy, cured sausage that's extremely popular in the U.S. It adds a savory, slightly spicy flavor.
            Sausage: Italian sausage, which can be mild or spicy, is another classic meat topping.
            Mushrooms: Sliced mushrooms add an earthy, umami flavor and pair well with many other toppings.
            Onions: Raw or caramelized, onions add sweetness and a bit of crunch.
            Bell Peppers: Colorful and slightly sweet, they bring a crisp texture and fresh flavor.
            Black Olives: A slightly bitter and salty addition, often used in Mediterranean-style pizzas.
            Ham/Prosciutto: Ham adds a savory taste, while prosciutto offers a more delicate, salty flavor.
            Basil: Fresh basil leaves are a staple of the Margherita pizza, offering a fragrant and slightly sweet touch.</p>

        <p>Neapolitan Pizza: The traditional pizza from Naples, Italy. It has a thin, soft crust, minimal toppings, and is cooked in a very hot wood-fired oven. The dough is typically made with just water, salt, yeast, and flour.

            New York-Style Pizza: Known for its large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust. The dough is stretched thin and is often sold by the slice.
            
            Chicago-Style Deep Dish: A thick, hearty pizza with a deep crust and layers of cheese, toppings, and chunky tomato sauce. It‚Äôs baked in a pan, resulting in a pie-like dish.
            
            Sicilian Pizza: This style features a thick, rectangular crust and is often served with tomato sauce and a variety of toppings. It has a focaccia-like texture.
            
            Detroit-Style Pizza: Similar to Sicilian, but it is rectangular and cooked in a deep, square pan, which gives it a crispy, cheesy crust. It often has the sauce added on top of the cheese.
            
            Roman Pizza: Typically thinner and crispier than Neapolitan pizza. It can also be served "al taglio" (by the slice) and is popular as street food in Italy.</p>
